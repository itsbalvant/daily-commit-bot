Inverse Finance
Introduction
Welcome to Inverse Finance. Whether you are an experienced DeFi user or new to the world of crypto, these docs are designed to provide you with a comprehensive understanding of everything related to Inverse Finance. Let's dive in!

What is Inverse Finance?
Inverse Finance is the decentralized autonomous organization that develops and manages the FiRM fixed rate lending protocol, DOLA, its debt-backed, decentralized stablecoin, and sDOLA, the yield-bearing version of DOLA.

Originally founded by Nour Haridy in late 2020, the protocol is governed by the Inverse Finance DAO, a collective of crypto enthusiasts. Our code base is open source and maintained by the community.

What Products Does Inverse Finance Offer?
Inverse Finance's main products are:

FiRM, a fixed-rate lending market

DOLA, a decentralized stablecoin pegged to the U.S. dollar

sDOLA, a yield-bearing version of our DOLA stablecoin

sINV, a yield bearing version of INV that does not require staking on FiRM.

DBR, a new DeFi primitive that enables holders to service DOLA loans on FiRM

What Makes Inverse Finance Unique?
Inverse Finance differentiates itself through:

Decentralization. The DAO prides itself on utilizing minimal collateral controlled by third party custodians and emphasizes fully-decentralized assets like ETH. The DAO's approach to on-chain governance remains unique among DAO's and seeks to continually drive towards censorship resistance.

State-of-the-Art Fixed Rate DeFi lending. Unlike protocols which offer short duration fixed rate loans, FiRM fixed rate loans can be of any duration and can be extended indefinitely. FiRM also implements unique security and risk measures and allows governance tokens deposited as collateral to retain their governance (voting) rights.

DOLA Borrowing Rights. The first tokenized interest rate for DeFi lending, DOLA Borrowing Rights are a new DeFi primitive with many applications including hedging, speculation, rate locking, and of course, borrowing.

DOLA Feds. Inverse Finance is able to inject DOLA into FiRM as well as third party lending markets, allowing for rapid expansion and contraction of DOLA supply to meet market needs and manage DOLA's US Dollar peg.

Transparency. The DAO is intensely focused on exposing all aspects of the protocol's operations via its transparency pages. Users can view liquidity, treasury, and many other areas of interest in real-time and on-demand.

Introduction
Organization
How is Inverse Finance Organized?
Inverse Finance is organized as a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) driven by community members who hold the INV token along with contributors that work full-time for the DAO. Contributors collectively bring many years of experience in cryptocurrency, DeFi, and blockchain development.

Working Groups
The DAO delegates certain decision making powers to working groups, which are granted limited autonomy and budget via DAO governance voting. The responsibilities of these working groups are determined within their proposals but all working groups are designed to ensure the DAO is able to meet fast moving market conditions, ensure day-to-day continuity of product development, relieve individual token voters from governance overload, and create a reliable and enjoyable community environment.

Current working groups include:

Product Working Group - The PWG is led by our developer 0xMT and is populated by core contributors driving product innovation and maintenance. The PWG is multidisciplinary and brings product ideas from the cradle of ideation, through validation from a user, business and feasibility perspective, into final implementation and maintenance.  

Growth Working Group - The Growth Working Group is led by patb and drives   business development, marketing, design, and community functions at Inverse Finance. From building awareness for Inverse products to building new exchange and liquidity partnerships to  developing new design assets for Inverse marketing, the GWG is focused on growing the “top line” DOLA circulation and revenue numbers for Inverse.

Treasury Working Group - The TWG is led by cryptoharry and was formed with the goal of optimizing management of treasury assets in order to support the DOLA ecosystem. This allows for fast and dynamic decisions to be made and executed to the benefit of the DAO, such as OTC deals, allocation of protocol owned liquidity and DeFi actions. Furthermore, the TWG allows for liquidity management to extend beyond just the Ethereum blockchain, such as on Optimism, Base, Arbitrum, and Polygon.

Risk Working Group - The RWG is led by edo and was formed to support all functions of Inverse Finance such as DOLA expansion, providing sound risk analysis, risk management, ongoing risk monitoring for existing products, and supporting the efforts of the other working groups. To learn more about our RWG, refer to their personalized Gitbook here.

Analytics Working Group - The AWG is led by naoufel with the main goal of enabling   users to seamlessly access the data they need and use it in the environment of their choice. The AWG supports other Working Groups, allowing them to make more informed decisions. The AWG provides users with different analysis dashboards, API endpoints, on-chain alerts,  and other tools that allow users to monitor events from different data sources (social networks, on-chain, etc) via Inverse.Watch.

Working groups are held accountable by DAO governance, are required to produce progress reports, and periodically re-apply for budget renewals. Delegates have insight into relevant Discord conversations and working groups can be modified or disbanded by a DAO vote. The DAO may also vote at any time to launch a new working group.



Inverse Finance
Introduction
Governance
How does Inverse Finance Governance Work?
INV holders hold voting power in our decentralized, on-chain governance system, Governor Mills, where one INV is equal to one vote. INV holders may directly or via a delegate launch a new proposal at any time. A minimum voting power of 1500 INV is required to submit a proposal. This amount was set and can be adjusted via a governance proposal.

How does Voting Work Within Inverse Finance?
We use a process centered around our on-chain proposal presentation and execution environment, called Governor Mills. We also socialize ideas and proposals on Discord and our Forum.

The Inverse Finance community has a social agreement to publish proposals on Governor Mills and the Forum for discussion and to debate the proposals for at least 24 hours before they are submitted on-chain. Please visit our official Discord and Forum to find the latest items and participate.

Casting votes can sometimes be prohibitively expensive due to gas costs. Delegating is free, however, so explore the voices in Inverse Finance DAO governance and consider having a delegate vote on your behalf..

What Steps Do I Take To Vote?
When a proposal has been submitted, you can vote using Governor Mills

To be eligible to vote, you need to delegate your votes either to yourself or to a Delegate before a proposal goes live.

Check for commentary on proposals in each Delegate's Discord channel.

Unless you have delegated to someone else, you will need to pay the Ethereum gas fee for the transaction as voting takes place on the Ethereum blockchain.



What Is A Delegate?
Delegates can be seen as public voices or representatives chosen by the Inverse Finance community. You can track their votes on the dedicated Delegates portal and read any discussions they take part of in the Forum and on Discord.

Once a Delegate reaches 1900 votes they’ll gain the power to queue draft proposals up for an on-chain vote.

Delegating your votes to a person of your choice will cost you no gas as you only need to sign a cryptographic proof using your wallet. You simply send them a direct message with the proof and the Delegate will register it on-chain.

The 1900 vote threshold for queuing a draft proposal is subject to change via a DAO vote and it was raised from 1000, meaning it is likely to be raised in the future to compensate for inflation.

How do I delegate my voting power?
If you don't expect to be active in DAO governance or would prefer to delegate your voting power to someone who you trust will represent your interests, you may want to give your INV power to a delegate. It's a popular route, especially when gas prices spike, and you can revoke a delegation at any time.

There are two ways to delegate: in FiRM when staking your INV, or independently by sending a signature to a delegate.

While in FiRM:

The INV market page provides a convenient way to select a delegate without the need to manually transmit a signature:

 

From the Governance tab:

1) You can find our current delegates in the Governance tab on FiRM and delegates are available for conversation through our Discord in the #delegates-pitch Discord channel and on the Inverse Forum.

2) Simply click on their link, connect your Metamask, Coinbase Wallet or WalletConnect and sign the message.

3) Copy-paste the outcome and send it to your delegate via Direct Message on Discord so that he can lock in your vote. Your tokens will remain in your account at all times. You must send this to your delegate so that they can lock in your vote.

The message looks similar to this one:

{“sig”:”0xad4268d4e493edadsa64186fba40a2cc60de936f5c22daebd45cec2646bc443a0a64bc53a8c543a12fa82641ea390b8b0fc855fb7984cdcc81f13c9988d123432we”,”nonce”:”0",”expiry”:10000000000,”chainId”:1,”signer”:”0xE0e8C1D73569806047234279a8e4C20276Fc2ds24"}

Note: If you lend/delegate your vote to someone else then you can't vote anymore, the delegate will vote for you. You have to trust that your delegate represents your interests but you can check their on-chain track record and discuss with them in the Discord if they are active. It’s free of charge.

Can I redirect my votes to a different delegate?
Delegation is not permanent and you can easily re-delegate to someone who better represents your interests, or to yourself. We encourage you to share your viewpoint in the Delegate's Discord channel.

Remember, you can always decide to redirect your votes to a new delegate at any time!

How Do I Create A Proposal?
Any INV holder can initiate a proposal. Some suggested steps for launching a proposal include:

It's usually a good idea to socialize the proposal with other community members in Discord in the Governance-General channel. Proposals made without this step have fared poorly to-date.

Create a forum post with the proposal in its entirety but without the actual code for the on-chain actions, just describe them. Once you do this, others can comment publicly on your proposal and you can respond to their comments and potentially use the feedback to improve your proposal. Of course it's a good idea here to encourage discussion of your Forum proposal by socializing it on Discord.

Schedule a Community Call. Not a hard requirement but for big proposals this is a really good idea! Contact the Growth Working Group to set up a community call in order to have a live discussion about your proposal.

Create a draft of the proposal on Governor Mills. The community has a social agreement to post all proposals on the forum and to allow a draft to be visible in GovMills for at least 24 hours the proposal is launched for an on-chain vote. A community call is also highly encouraged before launching an on-chain vote, especially for particularly novel or far-reaching proposals. 

Launch your proposal on-chain. Any INV holder holding at least 1900 INV, who is a delegate with at least 1900 votes, or who is a whitelisted DAO member can submit a proposal on-chain in Governor Mills. Voting remains open for approximately 60 hours, followed by a 40 hour holding period prior to proposal execution.

What Are Some Suggestions For Making A Successful Proposal?
First, feel free to expand deeper into the motivation and surrounding circumstances and narratives that motivate the proposal on the forum but keep it simple and to the point in the on-chain proposal. Include a link to the proposal's forum post in the on-chain proposal.

Other attributes of a successful proposal might include:

Clarity: Proposals should be written in easy to understand language. Proposals should clearly define and address a specific set of on-chain actions along with any responsibilities carried by DAO members or 3rd parties.

Completeness: All referenced and public information must be made accessible through the proposal. A proposal must not be dependent on future circumstances. Authors should disclose any and all conflicts of interest for all parties. Review active proposals to avoid overlap.

Accountability: Make sure that the execution of human responsibilities are worded in a way that makes defining success or failure easy to define.

Time: Include moderate time limits for experimental additions such as new WG's and extend them along with any budget in subsequent proposals.

Reporting: Include reporting requirements and make sure that the reports have a willing owner.

Budgeting: Long term contributors with a reliable workload are paid in DOLA through our Payroll contract. All expenses required to execute the entirety of the proposal must be accounted for in the proposal. If the proposal passes, a spending allowance will be created for the appropriate wallet for up to that amount from the Treasury.

Agency: Any required multi-signature wallets or other technical prerequisites must be created and willing key holders must be assigned before the execution of the proposal. Gas fees will be reimbursed by TWG if the proposal is passed.

How Is A Proposal Executed?
The proposal requires a minimum of 9500 FOR votes to pass quorum and it needs to have more FOR votes than AGAINST votes.

Once a proposal has passed, it must be queued on-chain. This action can be triggered by anyone who is willing to pay the gas fee (usually done by a DAO member). The proposal then enters a holding period of 40 hours to allow users time to prepare for the consequences of the execution of the proposal.

After the holding period, the proposal's execution can be triggered by anyone within 14 days. If the proposal is not executed within 14 days, it will expire and is no longer actionable.



Inverse Finance
Introduction
Transparency
Where Can I Find Out More About The Operations of Inverse Finance?
Transparency in traditional finance is achieved through financial reporting from private institutions and regulations from central authorities. However, in practice, full transparency is only to be achieved in a closed circle, often behind the protection of banking or industrial secrecy laws between regulating and regulated entities.

Conversely, Blockchain and its public nature are allowing any actor to track every single cash flow with perfect accuracy : financial transparency is made easier at a granular level through an ever growing ecosystem of analyzing tools (ie. Etherscan, Dune Analytics, Nansen etc.)

At Inverse Finance, transparency means that we strive to provide our users and the general public with all relevant information on our market strategy, assessments, and our DOLA monetary policy in an opened, clear and timely manner as well as the tools to process it.

View our state of the art Transparency page on the official Inverse Finance dApp.


The DAO values your right to be properly informed and make your own decisions : if you think that something should be communicated more openly or is misrepresented, please do not hesitate to get in touch with our core contributors.


Tokens
Inverse Finance DAO currently has three tradeable tokens that work together to form the industry’s most advanced fixed rate DeFi lending platform:

INV

DOLA 

DBR

Inverse Finance also has two tradeable yield-bearing versions of those tokens:

sDOLA, a yield-bearing version of DOLA whose yield is organically sourced from FIRM lending market revenues and auto-compounded.

sINV, a yield-bearing version of INV whose yield is sourced from INV staking and DBR streaming rewards and auto-compounded.

As illustrated below, borrowing on FiRM drives the issuance of DBR, which are streamed to INV stakers and sINV holders as DBR are spent by borrowers:


INV

INV
Inverse Finance Governance Token

Contract Address: INV on Ethereum
The INV token is unique among governance tokens:

INV holders who stake their INV on FiRM with two forms of continuous staking rewards: INV anti-dilution rewards and DBR streaming rewards. 

Staked INV can be used as collateral for long-term, fixed rate borrowing on the DAO’s fixed rate lending market, FIRM.

Like many governance tokens, INV provides holders with voting power in the Inverse Finance DAO,allowing them to directly control essential operating and development functions  of the DAO’s treasury, products, and operations.

An ERC-4626 vault token, sINV, autocompounds yield from staked INV on FiRM and allows users to receive INV yield without requiring staking on FiRM. More on sINV here.

How To Buy INV
INV is available to purchase on-chain, with deepest liquidity present on Curve and Balancer liquidity pools.

USDC/ETH/INV pool on Curve Finance

INV/DOLA/DBR pool on Curve Finance

INV/DOLA LP pool on Balancer

You can also input the INV token address 0x41d5d79431a913c4ae7d69a668ecdfe5ff9dfb68 into any Dex aggregator (Cowswap, 1inch, LlamaSwap, Matcha, etc). Ensure the slippage is within an acceptable range before executing the trade.

INV is also available to buy on the following centralized exchanges:

Coinbase

MEXC Global

Gate.io

CoinEx

INV Staking
INV holders who stake on FiRM are able to borrow DOLA against their staked INV, and receive two forms of INV staking rewards, in addition to their INV voting rights in the DAO’s governance system..

Benefits

Anti-Dilution Staking Rewards

INV holders are encouraged to deposit, or “stake” their INV in FiRM via staking rewards that are designed to mitigate the effects of periodic INV supply expansions to fund DAO liquidity and other expenses.These rewards incentivize the long-term holding of INV by users, reduce price volatility, and enable a fertile growth environment for the DAO.

INV stakers receive INV rewards continuously with every Ethereum block mined (roughly 6,400 times a day). The rate of rewards is continuously monitored and optimized by the Policy Committee. INV emissions directed to INV stakers are designed to be higher than INV emissions directed elsewhere. This ensures that INV stakers are protected from dilution and own an increasing proportion of the supply.

The DAO has consistently voted since early 2022 to ensure that stakers remain the primary beneficiaries of INV supply expansions by rewarding stakers with INV reward APY’s that closely track INV supply expansions. The rewards APY can therefore fluctuate as more or less INV is introduced. For greater historical context, please see our INV transparency pages.

DBR Real Yield Streaming Rewards

Separate from anti-dilution rewards, INV stakers receive real yield streamed in the form of DBR rewards calculated on a per INV basis, which can be held, swapped, or used to service a DOLA loan on FiRM. 

DBR streamed to INV stakers is in addition to the inflation adjusted INV rewards which make the added DBR staking rewards akin to Real Yield. The DBR APY will vary as DBR is issued in relation to DOLA borrowing on FiRM as well as . Keep an eye on DOLA borrows in FiRM and the Policy channel in our Discord for updates.

Issuing DBR to INV stakers aligns the interests of DOLA users and INV voters in the DAO. It interconnects the value flows of BDR burns as a result of DOLA borrowing in FiRM and the value of holding INV voting power over time, all of which benefit both INV stakers and the DAO via INV bonding.

DOLA Borrowing

INV stakers are also able to borrow DOLA against their staked INV position for long maturities and at fixed rates, using FiRM.

DAO Governance Voting Rights

Like INV holders, INV stakers retain their voting rights in the DAO’s on-chain governance system.

How To Stake INV
After buying INV tokens, staking INV can follow one of two paths based on how you acquired your INV.

Staking With a Non-Custodial Wallet


When using a non-custodial wallet like Metamask or Coinbase Wallet, ensure you have ETH in your wallet in order to pay for gas costs.  Then, within the FiRM application, select the INV market and proceed to the staking feature here.


As you deposit INV into FiRM, you will receive xINV tokens as receipts, which can always be swapped back to your original INV tokens when you unstake.

Upon staking, you will begin to receive staking rewards and your staked INV is eligible to be used as collateral for DOLA loans on FiRM.

Staking When Starting From A Centralized Exchange (e.g. Coinbase)

If you have INV on Coinbase or other centralized exchange or custodial service, it is highly recommended to  read their latest documentation for updates as their wallets may not interact with Ethereum smart contracts.

Using Coinbase as an example, utilize the “send” or “transfer” feature to transfer your INV to the Ethereum address of your (non-custodial) wallet like Metamask. 

Here are a series of screenshots to guide you through the process on Coinbase:






After you receive INV in your non-custodial wallet, you can begin the staking process. Note that in order to complete transactions on the Ethereum chain, you will need some ETH in your non-custodial wallet (e.g. Metamask) to pay for the Ethereum chain gas fees. Note also that it is possible to transfer Ethereum from your Coinbase account to your non-custodial wallet address.

Make sure that your non-custodial wallet is set to the Ethereum network, navigate to the inverse.finance website, and connect your wallet. Then begin the INV staking process as outlined for non-custodial wallets above.  

If you are not familiar with crypto wallets you can check this guide made by Coinbase: https://www.coinbase.com/learn/tips-and-tutorials/how-to-set-up-a-crypto-wallet

Cover

INV stakers can purchase "cover", which is a decentralized "insurance alternative" to protect against smart contract and other risks when staking INV. OpenCover offers cover for staked INV, sDOLA, as well as other assets on FiRM. Cover is underwritten by Nexus Mutual and claims are subject to DAO governance vote before payout. The Nexus Mutual docs are a good place to explore how cover works. 

How To Borrow Against INV
Staked INV, represented by xINV tokens, can be used as collateral on FiRM to borrow DOLA. For a step-by-step guide, see the “Using FiRM” section. 

How The Supply of INV Is Managed
The circulating supply of INV is subject to periodic expansions or emissions which are used to fund various DAO initiatives. The DAO has contracted INV once since its founding and retains the ability to burn additional INV in the future with governance consent.

Maximum Supply

As the circulating supply of INV changes periodically, the INV token does not have a coded or “hard capped” supply. The original social consensus from the start of the project was that there would never be an excess of 100,000 tokens in circulation. However, since the INV+ proposal (which represented a shift away from these tokenomics), the DAO moved to an "uncapped" total supply, allowing the Inverse Finance DAOInverse DAO to expand the supply of INV token through on-chain governance votes. These supply increases ensure the DAO has INV available for liquidity and operating expenses while ensuring that INV stakers can continue to be rewarded with anti-dilution rewards. This supply policy ensures optimal performance and competitive strength for Inverse Finance DAO. 

Buybacks

No formal buyback policy is currently in place. The Inverse Finance DAOInverse DAO has the ability to conduct a buyback of INV tokens using funds from the treasury. This has been done once before where $50,000 of INV was bought back from the open market, the proposal can be found here.

Use of INV Emissions

The DAO uses additional INV for multiple operating expenses, in addition to anti-dilution rewards described above.

Bond Expenses

Inverse Finance maintains a working relationship with Bond Protocol by utilizing their Olympus Pro bond program. This allows for users to purchase INV tokens at a discount in return for supplying liquidity pool tokens or DOLA. The amount of INV tokens supplied to the bond program is continually monitored and optimized by the Policy Committee.

Liquidity Mining Expenses

Inverse Finance provides INV incentives to certain DEX liquidity pools in order to ensure adequate liquidity for the DAO’s tokens, INV, DOLA, and DBR.

Anti-Dilution Rewards

As described above, INV stakers do not experience dilution as emissions to INV stakers are in excess of emissions to non-stakers and stakers’ proportional ownership of INV continually increases. So while additional minting of INV (as controlled by the on-chain DAO) will inflate the INV supply, it does NOT dilute INV stakers.

Governance of INV Supply Expansion 

The DAO retains control of the minting process via quarterly governance proposals, which to-date have provided the Policy Committee (multisig) with the ability to adjust the rate at which newly minted INV is distributed to stakers on a week-to-week or day-to-day basis.

The Policy Committee is responsible for setting the reward rate for xINV as well as allocating INV for bonding campaigns. This ensures that INV rates are always optimized to accrue maximum value both to INV holders and to the Inverse Finance DAO treasury. The Policy Committee is comprised of nine active Inverse Finance DAO team members. Inactive or retiring committee members are replaced via a Policy vote. All Policy Committee decisions require a quorum of 5 members out of 9 to conduct a vote. The policy Committee can be dissolved or replaced by Inverse Finance DAO governance, as with all enacted proposals.

Always check our transparency  pages for the most up to date information.

FAQ
What is INV?

INV is Inverse Finance’s governance token. 

What can I do with my INV?

You can stake your INV on FiRM, where you receive the ability to borrow DOLA against INV while you simultaneously receive continuous xINV anti-dilution rewards, DBR streaming rewards, and the continued ability to use INV for voting purposes, where 1 INV = 1 vote. 

How is the INV staking Annual Percentage Yield  determined?

The Policy Committee handles day-to-day changes to xINV reward rates as well as bond discount rates. INV stakers receive rewards proportionate to INV supply expansions to remain undiluted. Inverse Finance DAO can vote to set restrictions for intra-day changes in interest rates.

Can I borrow against my INV?

Yes - borrowing DOLA against INV is enabled on FiRM.  

Where can I buy INV?

INV is available to purchase on-chain on Curve, Balancer, UniswapV2, and Sushiswap.

NV is also available on the following centralized exchanges: Coinbase, MEXC Global, Gate.io, CoinEx.


DOLA
DOLA Stablecoin

DOLA is a decentralized, synthetic stablecoin pegged to the US Dollar. It is designed to be valued as close to $1 as possible with minimal volatility. DOLA is debt-backed rather than algorithmic, meaning that DOLA is over-collateralized with assets like stETH, WBTC, and others.

DOLA Basics
DOLA exists as an ERC20 token on Ethereum, Base, Arbitrum, Optimism, Mode, Blast, and Polygon. DOLA is also present on the BNB Chain but bridging is currently paused by Multichain.

An ERC-4626 vault token, sDOLA, autocompounds yield derived from FiRM lending revenues and allows users to receive yield on their staked DOLA while allowing them to use sDOLA in liquidity pools or as collateral on third party lending protocols. More on sDOLA here.

How To Buy DOLA
DOLA can be acquired by using any of the following methods:

Borrowing from FiRM or any partnered lending protocols

Buy DOLA from a decentralized exchange like Curve or Balancer

How To Borrow DOLA
Borrowing DOLA can be done in two primary ways: through Inverse Finance's FiRM or via third-party variable-rate lending protocols. This guide will walk you through both methods.

To borrow DOLA in FiRM, follow our guide in the Using FiRM Section.

DOLA may also be available on  third-party variable-rate lending platforms including Fraxlend. Llamalend, and Extra Finance. Each platform may offer different rates and terms and before you commit, be sure you understand the terms. Variable-rate loans allow the interest rate on your loan to  change over time. Ensure you understand the terms and the implications of rate changes. Also familiarize yourself with the repayment terms, including the duration and interest rates, to ensure they align with your financial goals and capabilities.

Always do your own research and be aware of the risks associated with borrowing in DeFi, including liquidation risks if the value of your collateral falls.

DOLA Yield Opportunities
You can see live opportunities with current APY's on our Yield Opportunities Dashboard.

ALL yield strategies carry additional smart contract risk and you should assume that no yield opportunities mentioned on this page have been audited by Inverse Finance. 

Different strategies carry different levels of risk, with some subject to potential impermanent loss or divergence loss, which can become a risk when DOLA is paired with volatile tokens, such as INV or wETH. Ensure that you do your own due diligence prior to interacting with any yield opportunity, and never invest more money than you are willing to lose.

DOLA USD Peg Management
DOLA's U.S. dollar peg is managed via the supply and demand for DOLA in the open market, primarily determined on decentralized exchanges like Curve, Balancer, and others. 

If DOLA’s market price rises above $1, this means there is more demand than supply in the open market. To counter this and bring DOLA’s price down to $1, the DAO mints more DOLA into existence, causing the price to return to equilibrium.

If DOLA’s market price falls below $1, this means there is more supply than demand in the open market. To counter this and bring DOLA’s price up to $1, the DAO contracts DOLA and burns it, causing the price to return to equilibrium. 

The DAO has two principal mechanisms for adjusting the supply of DOLA in the marketplace in order to ensure DOLA’s $1 peg:  DOLA DEX liquidity Feds and the DOLA Fed on FiRM.

DOLA DEX Liquidity Feds

DOLA DEX Liquidity Feds, commonly referred to as DOLA Feds, supply additional DOLA to DEX liquidity pools when the price of DOLA is above $1, and contract (or burn) DOLA from liquidity pools when the price of DOLA falls below $1. 

DOLA injected via DOLA Feds are backed by the LP tokens the DAO receives in exchange for the deposited DOLA.

DOLA Fed on FiRM

A dedicated DOLA Fed supplies DOLA to FiRM for purposes of lending. While multiple factors including risk are considered when expanding lending capacity on FiRM, DOLA’s U.S. dollar peg is a consideration in particular if and when DOLA’s peg is below $1, which puts the DAO in a contracting - not expansionary - position and therefore makes additional DOLA lending capacity unlikely and may even require contracting available lending capacity on FiRM.

DOLA Peg Management Operations

Inverse Finance DAO has voted to delegate peg maintenance to the Treasury Working Group and the Risk Working Group, who maintain the DOLA peg focusing on DOLA supply and demand. 

DOLA Cross-Chain Bridging 
PLEASE READ: Using cross-chain bridges comes with risk and Inverse Finance DAO makes no warranty or guarantee of their safety. You are strongly encourages to do your own research to ensure you understand any bridge fully before using.

The following is a brief summary of known options for bridging DOLA.

How Bridges Work

Bridges today are divided into two risk categories depending on the choice of technology and level of decentralization.

Bridges like Hop Protocol are on the centralized side of the spectrum which means that they are very fast but could carry censorship risks, along with the risk of an influential person or small group being a single point of failure.

The trade-offs are different for decentralized (native) bridges like the Optimism bridge or the Arbitrum bridge to Ethereum as you never give up self-custody of your funds and therefore don’t need liquidity on the destination chain, but you instead accept that it may take up to seven days to transfer the funds away from the destination chain (in is fast, out takes time).

Make sure that you are familiar with the underlying infrastructure that you are using: Ethereum provide the strongest security guarantees for tokens issued on Ethereum. Bridging tokens to other base layer chains change the token's risk profile drastically as you need to trust a custodian bridge. Even Ethereum layer 2 rollups like Arbitrum and OP Mainnet have some weaker or different security assumptions than Ethereum, but you can manually withdraw your funds from the rollup back to Ethereum.

Native/Trusted Bridges

Some users prefer to use a bridge operated by a “trusted” third party (e.g. Coinbase operates the Base native bridge). Native bridges typically offer bridging from a limited number of chains to the target (native) chain. 

Ethereum provides its security to "Layer 2" chains via native bridges which let you self-custody your funds while they are in transit and to and on the L2. Before bridging to an L2, ensure that you are familiar with the docs for the target chain and understand the risks of that protocol.

One downside of some L2 chains is that it may take up to seven days to transfer the funds away from the L2 chain back onto Ethereum or another chain.  Tip: remember to also send some of the L2’s gas token to the destination chain to be able to transact.

Some native L2 Bridges:

Optimism

Arbitrum

Base

Blast

Mode

Other native bridges:

Some L1 blockchains are independent from Ethereum's security but are nonetheless compatible with the Ethereum's execution environment and often have custodial  bridges of their own. 

Polygon. Polygon's bridge is non-custodial and more similar to the L2 bridges. Tip: check for liquidity before bridging.

Third Party Bridges

There are several commercial bridges that usually are fast and connect both L1's and L2's. They require there to be pre-existing liquidity on the destination chain and most of them custody your funds during the transaction. Check for liquidity before bridging. Note that Multichain is out of commission, revoke all approvals and avoid using their services until the situation is resolved. Here are a twofew custodial bridges:

Across

Hop

Bridge Aggregators

Bridge aggregators search for the least expensive route and Inverse makes use of Socket on the combined swapping and bridging page on the Inverseour website. Bridge aggregators search for an optimal route and also aggregates DEXes across chains to allow you to swap from any token on one chain into any other token on the destination chain:

Always check if there is enough DOLA liquidity on the other chain to transact before you bridge. Look up the analytics of the protocol that you are using, and also check both the bridge liquidity and the pool liquidity if you intend to swap on the destination chain. If the liquidity pools on the chain are low on DOLA you benefit from positive slippage if you bring DOLA to trade. If the pools have an excess of DOLA on the other hand you benefit from purchasing it.

Different bridge types have different properties and it's not a given that prices or transaction times are the same moving DOLA onto or off from any specific chain. The decentralized bridge off from Optimism or Arbitrum can take some time to exit. Anyone can challenge the validity of a transaction and a challenged transaction moving off the bridge could remain pending for up to ca 7 days before the challenge is concluded.

The private bridges offer faster bridging speeds and have more liquidity but they have a different risk profile. Take a moment to edit the allowance when you are prompted to approve the transfer and set it to match the sum you are sending. Infinite approvals carry a risk if the protocol is compromised.

Leap

Head to the bridge of your choice with DOLA at the ready.

Make sure that your wallet is pointed to the chain that you are starting from.

Select the target chain.

Approve the allowance for the sum.

Confirm the transaction to send the funds, and wait.

FAQ
Where does the DOLA that I borrow come from?

An Inverse Finance DOLA Fed contract mints DOLA to FiRM, where the DAO is the sole supplier of DOLA on FiRM. Subject to risk and other parameters, the DAO may expand or contract DOLA available to borrow in FiRM. 

Is DOLA an algorithmic stablecoin? 

No. DOLA is debt-backed which means that each DOLA is 100% backed by collateral assets staked in FiRM or by the Liquidity Provider token in a liquidity position created by a DOLA Fed. INV is not used to mint or redeem DOLA, though it can be used as collateral in FiRM.

What are the advantages of DOLA?

In the world of DeFi, there is no shortage of stablecoin protocols. What makes DOLA unique compared with other stablecoins is that DOLA is:

Debt-backed. DOLA is fully debt-backed and not a partially collateralized algorithmic stablecoin.

Decentralized. DOLA operates via fully decentralized, on-chain DAO governance and apart from a nominal amount of DAI (not decentralized) being used as collateral, FiRM is 100% backed by debt denominated in decentralized assets.

Supported by DOLA Liquidity Feds. DOLA Feds allow Inverse to rapidly deploy liquidity on chains other than Ethereum like Arbitrum, Optimism, or Base and to simultaneously use DOLA Feds to manage DOLA’s USD peg.

Transparent.  Inverse provides an unusually high degree of transparency into its operations through the aggressive publishing data about Inverse tokens and products on our Transparency pages.

DBR
DOLA Borrowing Right Token

The DBR is an ERC20 token that represents your right to borrow DOLA in FiRM, Inverse's fixed rate lending protocol. A user with a single DBR has the right to borrow one DOLA stablecoin for up to one year with no interest.


DBR’s solve issues of highly volatile interest rates in traditional variable rate lending and DBR removes many of the constraints of conventional fixed rate interest lending in DeFi. Users benefit from the certainty of fixed-rate loans while gaining both short and long-term optionality and opportunities from DOLA Borrowing Rights.


The duration is not fixed so you can borrow two DOLA for six months, four DOLA for three months, and so on. Borrowing one DOLA for one year will gradually consume that DBR token.


Buying DBR
Via Automated Market Makers

DBR is available on Curve Finance in the triDBR LP.  You can also input the DBR token address (listed above) into any DEX aggregator (Cow, 1inch, LlamaSwap, Matcha, etc). Ensure the slippage is within an acceptable range before executing the trade. 

Via DBR XY=K Auction

A new method for acquiring DBR is via Inverse’s XY=K DBR auction. XY=K auctions operate as a virtual, xy = k constant function market maker auction. The XY=K Auction permissionlessly allows users to buy DBR using DOLA. In the auction, the price of DBR (per DOLA) continuously reduces every second, until a DBR purchase is made at which point the price increases. MEV bots will likely monitor the auction, executing arbitrage transactions between it and the TriDBR pool on curve as soon as it becomes profitable. A front end is available via inverse.finance/xykauction to make interaction with the auction easier.


The XY=K auction contract includes the sendToSaleHandler() function, that anyone can call. This moves accumulated DOLA proceeds to the saleHandler contract, which currently includes logic that uses the DOLA to repay the DOLA borrowBalance of either 0xf508c58ce37ce40a40997C715075172691F92e2D or 0xeA0c959BBb7476DDD6cD4204bDee82b790AA1562 (the 2 Frontier exploiters of 2022). The logic of the saleHandler contract can be updated by governance in the future, for example, to send the DOLA proceeds to the Treasury.

The DAO sets a yearly max budget of DBR to be used by the auction, with an operator (the Fed Chair multisig) able to set the DbrRatePerYear between 0 and this governance set max.

In addition to this becoming a powerful (automated) tool for repayment of DOLA bad debt, the auction also has the additional benefit of increasing the current depth of DBR liquidity on the market for buyers. This improves the user experience for borrowers on FiRM, particularly ones with much larger positions who want to purchase DBR for longer-duration loans.

DBR Issuance Rate
DBR supplies are adjusted according to a DBR Issuance Rate that encompasses two methods of adding DBR’s to the marketplace: DBR Streaming Rewards and DBR XY=K Auctions. 

The rate at which DBR’s are issued into the market is done at a rate set by the Fed Chair multisig and subject to governance vote, but currently at a maximum annual rate equal to a ratio of 1 DBR for every DOLA being lent out on FiRM.

DBR Streaming Rewards

DBR is streamed at a rate advertised in the FiRM application to INV holders who stake their INV on FiRM. These DBR’s are continually streamed with each new block mined on Ethereum, and users can claim streamed DBR’s at any time. 

DBR’s are streamed at a rate set by the Fed Chair multisig and subject to governance vote, but currently with a maximum annual rate equal to a ratio of 1 DBR for every DOLA being lent out on FiRM.

DBR issued to INV stakers is in addition to the inflation adjusted INV rewards which make the added DBR staking rewards akin to Real Yield.

Via DBR XY=K Auctions

DBR is also introduced into the marketplace via DBR XY=K auction, a type of dutch auction that provides users with a way of purchasing large blocks of DBR without causing upwards pressure on DBR prices. The DAO sets a yearly max budget of DBR to be used by the auction, with an operator (the Fed Chair multisig) able to set the DbrRatePerYear between 0 and this governance set maximum.

Impact of Increasing DBR Supply

An increase in DBR supply will generally lead to a lower DBR price which in turn makes borrowing DOLA on FiRM more attractive. As DBR is burned over the life of a DOLA loan, the DBR rewardRate will correspond to the amount of DOLA loans on FiRM. The Fed Chair determines whether this quantity should be maintained, increased or decreased.

To expand the amount of DOLA lent out on FiRM, the yearly DBR issuance rate is adjusted to the expanded DOLA lending target. For example, if 5,000,000 DOLA is loaned on FiRM but the target is 8,000,000 DOLA, the DBR issuance rate should be set to 8,000,000 DBR per year. DBR supply contraction reverses the process and sets a DBR issuance rate that is lower than the amount of DOLA borrowed in FiRM.

Replenishment & Liquidations
DBR Replenishment
If a user’s DBR balance turns negative while borrowing DOLA on FiRM, additional DBR’s are added by any 3rd party for a fee to the user’s wallet to maintain a positive DBR balance. This process is called Replenishment.

The cost of additional DBR’s during Recharge is paid by adding DOLA debt to the user’s loan balance. DBR’s purchased via Replenishment is priced at a substantial premium to market DBR pricing to incentivize responsible loan management and to avoid having to rely on oracle infrastructure.

The Replenishment feature can be repeated if the borrower fails to top-up their DBR balance or repay their loan, until the borrower’s DOLA loan balance reaches the maximum collateral factor for the loan, triggering a liquidation process.

Liquidations
The liquidation process follows common DeFi liquidation practices where a fee (e.g., 10%) is collected by third-party liquidators who successfully repay loans that have become eligible for liquidation due to a breach of a borrower’s collateral factor. An additional liquidation fee may also be charged by the Inverse Finance DAO treasury. Inverse Finance DAO reserves the rights to alter the current liquidation process in future updates to the FiRM protocol. Any modifications would require a DAO vote via on-chain governance.

Using DBR’s
Here are five examples to illustrate the basic application of DBR’s:

One Year Loan

Jack deposits $1,000 in WETH as collateral and borrows $800 in DOLA. He plans to hold the loan for one year so acquires 800 DBR’s for $0.02 each. The $16 payment for the DBR’s is subtracted from Jack’s $800 DOLA loan at the time of borrowing.

Jack’s balance of 800 DBR’s is decremented on a time basis, so for every DOLA borrowed, the DBR balance is reduced by 0.xxxxxxxxx DBR every second or 1/365 per day.

Multi-Year Loan

Jack deposits $1,000 in WETH as collateral and borrows $800 in DOLA. He plans to hold the loan for three years so acquires 2,400 DBR’s for $0.02 each. The $48 payment for the DBR’s is subtracted from Jack’s $800 DOLA loan at the time of borrowing.

Jack’s balance of 2,400 DBR’s is decremented on a time basis, so for every DOLA borrowed, the DBR balance is reduced by 0.xxxxxxxxx DBR every second or 1/365 per day.

Short-Term Loan

Jack deposits $1,000 in WETH as collateral and borrows $800 in DOLA. He plans to hold the loan for three days so acquires 6.58 DBR’s for $0.02 each. The $0.13 payment for the DBR’s is subtracted from Jack’s $800 DOLA loan at the time of borrowing.

Jack’s balance of 6.58 DBR’s is decremented on a time basis, so for every DOLA borrowed, the DBR balance is reduced by 0.xxxxxxxxx DBR every second or 1/365 per day.

Loan Period Starting at a Future Date

Jack predicts he will soon need to take out a loan to pay for college tuition and purchases 1000 DBR as the price drops to $0.01, realizing the rate is far superior to other DeFi and traditional lending markets and that DBR price is unlikely to remain so cheap.

Simple Carry

Jack has found a good yield opportunity for DOLA and he has 10 WETH that he wants to make productive. He decides to deposit it into FiRM to borrow DOLA which he in turn will use to farm yield in a Velodrome liquidity pool on Optimism. Jack borrows 50.000 DOLA and includes the purchase of 50.000 DBR in the transaction which brings the total debt to 52.500 DOLA.

Jack now deposits the DOLA in one of his favorite yield strategies, earning more than the cost of the loan. If the yield from the liquidity pool declines below his DBR cost for the DOLA loan, Jack can repay the loan and sell the remaining DBR.

DBR Use Cases
The introduction of DBR’s provides for a broader set of use cases for DOLA loans than is typically possible or practical with variable rate loans. A sample of these new use cases includes.

Yield Farming

DBRs enable yield farmers to borrow at predictable rates over long time periods, eliminating the uncertainty of interest rate spikes common in variable rate lending. Yield farmers who “loop” their strategies are assured that their DOLA borrowing rate will not spike and eventually trigger a cascade of liquidations. Additionally, in the case where yield farming activities rise, a farmer utilizing DBR could capture profits (from higher DBR prices) at the very moment that underlying farming activities are becoming less profitable.

Real World Assets

DBR’s are ideal for borrowers financing “real world” assets (“RWA’s”) like home down payments, a car, or college tuition. Financing costs can be fixed for many years and like yield farming, DBR’s solve for the uncertainty of variable rate borrowing or the hidden costs of other “fixed rate” lending. DBR’s also enable sellers of RWA’s like a home to “transfer” their 11 (below market rate) DBR’s along with the asset itself to a buyer, like real-world assumable mortgages.

Rate Locking

Potential borrowers wishing to “lock in” a borrowing rate in advance of executing a loan can do so by purchasing DBR’s and holding them until the loan is executed. Borrowers and investors concerned about future rate increases may wish to accumulate DBR’s as a hedge against future rate rises.

Insurance/Cover

DBR’s enable users to borrow at a fixed rate to purchase cover from projects like Nexus Mutual, making the cost of using leverage to purchase cover more predictable.

Collars

DBR’s enable users to limit downside losses on assets by borrowing at a fixed rate against the asset to purchase put options from projects like Hegic, making the cost of using leverage to collar a position more predictable.

Rate Arbitrage

DBR’s enable traders to implement new interest rate strategies that rely on fixed rate leverage to execute against arbitrage opportunities with rates on other lending protocols or even with traditional finance instruments like U.S. Treasury bonds, since both borrowing costs and bond yields are fixed.

DAO Treasury And Payroll Operations

DBR’s enable DAO’s to borrow against dormant Treasury assets without the uncertainty of variable rates, enabling the Treasury to fund operational expenses like payroll or liquidity mining. DAO expenses can be paid utilizing DBR’s to avoid negative price action on governance tokens, which themselves can be safely and predictably staked as collateral for DOLA loans.


sDOLA
sDOLA is a yield-bearing, synthetic stablecoin that derives its yield from Inverse Finance’s FiRM fixed rate lending market revenues. Users who stake DOLA receive a constant stream of DBR’s, which are auto-compounded into more DOLA, resulting in yield-bearing sDOLA. 

Depositing DOLA for sDOLA incentivizes the long-term holding of DOLA, resulting in significantly reduced liquidity costs per circulating DOLA and improved overall unit economics of the protocol. Importantly, there is a 1:1 relationship between DOLA staked into sDOLA and additional lending capacity on FiRM given the increased demand for holding DOLA, leading to greater FiRM revenue.

sDOLA Basics
 sDOLA is designed as a tokenized ERC-4626 wrapper around a DOLA Savings Account (DSA) smart contract which continually streams DBR rewards to DOLA staked in the contract and auto-compounds those rewards into additional DOLA, leading to the DOLA:sDOLA exchange rate to continuously grow

Minting sDOLA
The underlying asset for sDOLA is Inverse Finance’s DOLA stablecoin, which is borrowable on FIRM or available on Automated Market Makers like Curve or Balancer. To mint sDOLA, a user stakes DOLA in a DOLA Savings Account (DSA) smart contract, which in turn is deposited in an ERC-4626 compliant vault, resulting in a new wrapped token, sDOLA, on Ethereum mainnet.


Important points about minting sDOLA:

DOLA staked to mint sDOLA is never rehypothecated or loaned to third parties. 

The sDOLA token represents pro rata deposits within the ERC-4626 vault and is always withdrawable for DOLA stablecoins at the pro rata rate. 

There is no maximum number of sDOLA that may be minted by a user depositing DOLA.

To stake DOLA for sDOLA, simply go to https://inverse.finance/sDOLA and follow the instructions:

First, select the "sDOLA" tab on the upper navigation bar:


And select "sDOLA" in the pulldown menu:


Connect your wallet:


Next, indicate the desired amount of DOLA to stake as sDOLA:


Approve the desired amount of DOLA in your wallet (gas required):


Confirm the transaction in your wallet (gas required):


You can keep track of your sDOLA deposits and earnings (along with INV, DBR, and FIRM borrowing positions on the dashboard page located at https://www.inverse.finance/dashboard 


sDOLA ​​Yield Accrual
sDOLA yield is derived from DBR revenue generated by borrowers on Inverse Finance’s FiRM fixed rate lending market. As DBR’s are spent by borrowers on FiRM, those spent DBR’s are recognized as revenue for the DAO, which is then re-distributed in three ways to:

INV stakers, in the form of DBR streaming rewards

The DSA (DOLA Savings Account) smart contract, powering sDOLA

The DBR XY=K Auction


The yield of sDOLA accumulates continually via growth of the dbrReserves accrued in the DSA (sDOLA) contract.

sDOLA Auto-compounding 
A unique aspect of sDOLA is the automatic compounding of the continuous DBR yield accrual into additional DOLA. DBR yield auto-converts to more DOLA, so a user’s DOLA balance staked in sDOLA is continually growing. There is therefore no need to claim yield in separate, manual transactions and no human intervention is required by the user or by DAO contributors during the auto-compounding process. 


To convert DBR yield into more DOLA for the user, the DBR yield must be first swapped for DOLA. sDOLA implements the DAO’s XY=K Auction contract, meaning this will create additional depth to DBR’s market and run in a fully automated manner via Miner Extractable Value (MEV). 

The XY=K Auction operates as a virtual, x*y = k constant function market maker auction. The purpose is to provide a market-driven, continuous, Dutch auction for DBR, paid in DOLA. DBR reserves increase over time, pushing down the price of DOLA in the auction, until the price is low enough for an arbitrageur to extract profits. Upon a successful trade, the buyer will deposit DOLA in return for freshly minted DBR. Essentially the contracts function very similarly to a Uniswap V2 pool, except one side of the pair is virtual (DOLA), and the other (DBR) has a continuous stream of new tokens being added to the reserves.

After swapping DBR for DOLA, the additional DOLA is staked in the DOLA Saving Rate contract and will accrue value to sDOLA in the following week.

sDOLA Yield Distribution
Yield generated from sDOLA's DBR-DOLA swaps is allocated to sDOLA holders on a pro-rata basis over a 7-day period. This distribution cycle is structured on a weekly basis, with weeks starting and finishing at roughly Thursday 00:00 UTC each time. The yield for any given week is derived from auction activities in the preceding week.

This mechanism implies that as the supply of sDOLA increases, the current yield lags the projected yield, appearing lower. This is because the revenue earned in the previous week was from a comparatively smaller sDOLA supply than the present distribution base. Conversely, if sDOLA supply diminishes due to withdrawals, remaining holders experience a temporarily enhanced yield until the current and projected yields align. Importantly, sDOLA does not have a predefined minimum or maximum APY.

Withdrawing sDOLA
Users may unwrap their sDOLA at any time through a conventional un-staking transaction. There is no maturity date, no waiting period to withdraw DOLA, and users may re-stake into sDOLA at any time.

DOLA Savings Account
The DSA smart contract allows users to stake their DOLA stablecoin and earn DBR. While the main use of the DOLA Savings Account (DSA) is expected to be via sDOLA, we anticipate that users and third party integrators who believe DBR is currently underpriced will utilize the DSA.

Cover

Users can purchase "cover", which is a decentralized "insurance alternative" to protect against smart contract and other risks when staking sDOLA. OpenCover offers cover for sDOLA as well as assets on FiRM. Cover is underwritten by Nexus Mutual and claims are subject to DAO governance vote before payout. The Nexus Mutual docs are a good place to explore how cover works. 

FAQ
What is sDOLA?

sDOLA is a yield-bearing stablecoin structured as an ERC-4626 wrapper around a DOLA Savings Account (DSA) contract that continuously streams DOLA Borrowing Rights rewards to staked DOLA and auto-compounds them. 

What is the DOLA Savings Account?

The DOLA Savings Account (DSA) smart contract allows users to stake their DOLA stablecoin and earn DBR. While the main use of the DSA is expected to be via sDOLA, users who believe DBR may be currently underpriced may elect to utilize the DSA, as well as other protocol integrations.

What are the advantages of sDOLA?

Decentralized yield. sDOLA departs from other yield-bearing stablecoin products via its sourcing of yield from non-centralized sources. sDOLA’s reliance on DBR-based yield requires no centralized assets or custodians while DOLA itself is backed by decentralized debt. This contrasts with yield-bearing protocols which largely or entirely derive their yield from centralized, U.S. government sources.   

Fixed-rate lending revenue as yield source.  sDOLA relies on fixed-rate lending revenues as a source of yield. Compared to variable rate lending protocols, which on average generate a lower rate of return due to lower opportunity cost of capital, FiRM relies on fixed-rate borrowing revenue which are priced at a premium vis-a-vis variable rate lending protocols.

No rehypothecation of the underlying stablecoin. Unlike yield bearing stablecoins that loan user deposits to third parties, DOLA staked as sDOLA is never loaned and remains staked within the sDOLA smart contract until withdrawn. 

Non-dilutive. Unlike yield bearing stablecoins which rely on new emissions of a governance token as a source of yield, sDOLA utilizes no emissions of INV governance tokens as a source of yield and only distributes revenue earned on FiRM.




sINV
Yield-bearing staked INV

sINV, or staked INV, brings the INV governance token to users who do not trade on Ethereum mainnet or who do not use FiRM. sINV also gives users a way to hold INV without the need to manually claim rewards, while creating opportunities to make sINV available in liquidity pools or as loan collateral on third party lending markets.

sINV is a yield-bearing, synthetic token that derives its yield by autocompounding rewards sent to INV stakers on Inverse Finance’s FiRM lending market. Users who stake INV as sINV receive a constant stream of DBR’s, in addition to INV staking rewards, which are continually swapped into more INV, resulting in yield-bearing sINV.

Depositing INV for sINV further incentivizes the long-term holding of INV, creates continuous market buy pressure on INV, and resulting in reduced liquidity costs per circulating INV and improved overall unit economics of the protocol.

sINV Basics
sINV is designed as a tokenized ERC-4626 wrapper around the INV market on FiRM.  An XY=K Dutch  auction swaps DBR streaming rewards for INV and, along with INV staking rewards, deposits the INV into FiRM and the vault smart contract, leading to the INV:sINV exchange rate to continuously grow. Please note that the INV deposited into sINV do not  retain their on-chain governance voting rights.

Minting sINV
The underlying asset for sINV is Inverse Finance’s INV governance token, which is available on Automated Market Makers like Curve or Balancer. 

To mint sINV, a user stakes INV in the sINV smart contract, which is a ERC-4626 compliant vault, resulting in a new wrapped token, sINV, on Ethereum mainnet.

Important points about minting sINV:

The sINV token represents pro rata deposits within the ERC-4626 vault and is always withdrawable for INV governance tokens  at the pro rata rate.

There is no maximum number of sINV that may be minted by a user depositing INV.

INV staked to mint sINV is never rehypothecated or loaned to third parties.

sINV ​​Yield Accrual
sINV yield is derived from two sources: xINV staking (or “anti-dilution”) rewards and DBR streaming rewards. 

xINV Staking Rewards. xINV staking rewards function as a remedy to dilution experienced by INV holders when the DAO mints INV in order to fund liquidity and other DAO operations. Until the release of sINV, xINV staking rewards were available exclusively to INV stakers on FiRM. For both sINV users and INV stakers on FiRM, xINV staking rewards are added automatically to a user’s staking position on a continual basis with each Ethereum block.

DBR Streaming Rewards. DBR streaming rewards function as a revenue sharing mechanism for holders INV stakers. DBR’s are a primary revenue generator for the DAO and are issued to INV stakers who in turn sell them in marketplaces or auctions, primarily to borrowers who need them for DOLA loans on FiRM. Until the release of sINV, DBR streaming rewards were available exclusively to INV stakers on FiRM and required users to manually claim their DBR streaming rewards. With sINV, DBR streaming rewards are automatically swapped for INV via a dedicated XY=K Dutch auction and deposited weekly into the sINV vault with no manual claiming required by the user.

sINV Yield Auto-compounding
A powerful  aspect of sINV is the automatic compounding of the continuous DBR streaming rewards yield  accrual into additional INV. DBR yield auto-converts to more INV, so a user’s INV balance staked in sINV is continually growing. There is therefore no need to claim DBR reward yield in separate, manual transactions and no human intervention is required by the user or by DAO contributors during the auto-compounding process. 

The token flows involved in autocompounding sINV can be illustrated as follows:


To convert DBR yield into more INV for the user, the DBR yield must be first swapped for INV. sINV implements the DAO’s XY=K Auction contract, meaning this will create additional depth to DBR’s market and run in a fully automated manner via Miner Extractable Value (MEV).

The XY=K Auction operates as a virtual, x*y = k constant function market maker auction. The purpose is to provide a market-driven, continuous, Dutch auction for DBR, paid in INV. DBR reserves increase over time, pushing down the price of INV in the auction, until the price is low enough for an arbitrageur to extract profits. Upon a successful trade, the buyer will deposit INV in return for freshly minted DBR. Essentially the contracts function very similarly to a Uniswap V2 pool, except one side of the pair is virtual (INV), and the other (DBR) has a continuous stream of new tokens being added to the reserves.

sINV Yield Distribution
Yield generated from sINV's DBR-INV swaps is allocated to sINV holders on a pro-rata basis over a 7-day period. This distribution cycle is structured on a weekly basis, with weeks starting and finishing at roughly Thursday 00:00 UTC each time. The yield for any given week is derived from auction activities in the preceding week.

This mechanism implies that as the supply of sINV increases, the current yield lags the projected yield, appearing lower. This is because the revenue earned in the previous week was from a comparatively smaller sINV supply than the present distribution base. Conversely, if sINV supply diminishes due to withdrawals, remaining holders experience a temporarily enhanced yield until the current and projected yields align. Importantly, sINV does not have a predefined minimum or maximum APY.

FAQ
What is sINV?

sINV is a yield-bearing version of the DAO’s INV governance token  structured as an ERC-4626 wrapper around a INV smart  contract that continuously autocompounds both streamed INV staking rewards (via FiRM) as well as streamed DOLA  Borrowing Rights (DBR’s) to a single token, sINV.  

What are the advantages of sINV?

Convenience. sINV users no longer need to manually claim DBR streaming rewards as they are deposited directly into an sINV vault.

Portability. sINV allows INV holders to enjoy the benefits of INV staking on FiRM while also affording them the ability to hold sINV outside of FiRM and move it across chains, deposit in liquidity pools, or use as collateral on lending markets.

Decentralized yield. sINV departs from other yield-bearing stablecoin products via its sourcing of yield from non-centralized sources. sINV’s reliance on DBR-based yield requires no centralized assets or custodians while INV itself has no third party contingencies or custodians. This contrasts with yield-bearing protocols which largely or entirely derive their yield from centralized or government sources.  

No rehypothecation of the underlying governance token. The INV you stake in the sINV contract is never loaned to a third party.

How is the sINV projected APY calculated?  

The projected APY is a theoretical estimation of where the APY should tend to go. It's calculated by considering current's week auction revenue and a forecast that considers the DBR incentives, where the forecast portion has a weight of more than 50%, plus the xINV APR.

Can sINV holdersk participate in Inverse on-chain governance?

For now, sINV holders cannot participate in on-chain governance - if you want to continue to vote or delegate you'll need to stay staked on FiRM.

I have had my Inverse staked on FiRM for while, can I still leave it to continue to get rewards or do I need to convert it to sINV?

You can leave it right where it is. One advantage of sINV is that DBR rewards are claimed for you and autocompounded, while with your staked INV position on FiRM you'll need to periodically claim your DBR rewards manually.

Is there a lock period for sINV?

No. Users may unstake and withdraw at any time.

What is sINV v1 vs. sINV v2?

sINV was launched under "guarded mode" in September 2024 in order to limit deposits and reduce risk exposure while allowing the team to monitor and make adjustments during the early stages. This strategy resulted in the detection of a minor issue and the contract was redeployed to safeguard the long-term integrity of the sINV product.

FiRM
Inverse Finance's Fixed Rate Market


FiRM, the Fixed Rate Market, is Inverse Finance’s fixed rate lending protocol that implements a new DeFi primitive called DOLA Borrowing Rights. Borrowers on FiRM may borrow at fixed rates for unlimited durations. A novel money market architecture, Personal Collateral Escrows, ensures that different tokens from different users are not co-mingled.

Read the FiRM Whitepaper or watch our FiRM and DBR explainer video above for a quick introduction.

Deposit your collateral of choice in the FiRM app.Make sure that you have enough ETH to continue transacting as it is the gas token of the Ethereum blockchain.

Decide how much DOLA you want to borrow. Note that if your collateral drops in value to the point where your deposit no longer meets the collateral factor, or you borrow the maximum amount of DOLA that you are allowed, you may get liquidated.

Input the loan duration you wish to secure or DBR amount that you wish to purchase as a part of the borrowing transaction. The cost of the DBR will be added to your DOLA debt.

Double-check that the app parameters express what you intend and execute the transaction. There may be multiple transactions to approve and execute depending on how complex the transaction is.

Repaying A Loan, Step-By-Step
Click the button “Exit Mode”. The tabs let you decide if you want to repay, withdraw collateral or both at the same time.

Enter the amount of DOLA that you want to repay.

Enter the amount of the collateral tokens that you want to withdraw.

Execute the transaction.

FiRM Lending Requirements
To borrow DOLA in FiRM, a user must first deposit collateral in one of the markets.

The user must also hold DBR tokens to service the debt. DBR's can be purchased on the open market or you can buy DBR tokens as part of the loan transaction.

Collateral
INV
INV is the governance token of Inverse Finance, used for decision-making in the platform's DeFi applications like lending and borrowing.

WETH

Wrapped Ethereum (WETH) is an ERC-20 compatible version of ether that allows ETH to be universally compatible across all dApps and smart contracts.

wstETH
wstETH is a wrapped version of a liquid staking derivative of ETH, stETH from Lido. wstETH carries intrinsic yield which is ideal for collateral tokens. Lido is a decentralized protocol allowing users to stake ETH and participate in the consensus mechanism of Ethereum. wstETH is a tax optimized asset as not subject to constant income from rebases.

WBTC

Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC) is Bitcoin (BTC) that has been converted for use on the Ethereum ecosystem. It’s an ERC-20 (Ethereum) token that’s backed one-to-one by Bitcoin (BTC), which means that one WBTC will usually equal one bitcoin.

CVX
CVX is the native token of Convex Finance, granting governance rights and a share in trading fees and rewards for liquidity providers on Curve Finance.

cvxFXS
cvxFXS represents staked FXS tokens in Convex Finance, offering enhanced yield and governance rights within the Frax Finance ecosystem.

DAI
DAI is a decentralized stablecoin pegged to the US Dollar, created by locking collateral in MakerDAO’s smart contracts, providing a stable currency for crypto transactions. FiRM implements the DAI Savings Rate module, which offers a source of yield for DAI stakers.

CRV
The purpose of the Curve DAO token is to incentivise liquidity providers on the Curve Finance's decentralized exchange. CRV can be staked and locked for up to four years to maximize voting power and other protocols have build composable tokens based on locked CRV (veCRV).

cvxCRV
Convex cvxCRV is built on veCRV and offers intrinsic yield selectable as stablecoin or volatile yield which is an ideal traid for a collateral token. FiRM borrowers using cvxCRV maintain their voting power on the Convex platform while borrowing DOLA.

st-yCRV
st-yCRV is a tokenized version of staked yCRV (Yearn Curve) liquidity tokens, earning yield in the Yearn Finance ecosystem.

st-yETH

st-yETH is a staked version of the yETH token, derived from Yearn Finance’s innovative yETH protocol, which itself is a liquidity pool token consisting of various Ethereum Liquid Staking Derivatives (LSTs).

sFRAX

sFRAX is an ERC4626 staking vault that distributes a portion of the Frax protocol revenue denominated in FRAX. This revenue is generated from governance-approved AMOs/strategies and/or real-world asset (RWA) strategies from off-chain sources. The sFRAX vault APY is based on a utilization function that can be set by the frxGov governance module.

sUSDe

sUSDe is a synthetic dollar protocol built on Ethereum that is essentially a yield-bearing version of USDe, Ethe. When users stake USDe, they receive sUSDe, which accrues yield over time. This yield comes from multiple sources including staking rewards from Ethereum and profits from derivatives market spreads, thanks to Ethena's strategy involving delta-hedging and leveraging Ethereum's staking mechanism.

PT-sUSDe

Pendle allows users to wrap yield-bearing tokens into SY (standardized yield tokens), which is a wrapped version of the underlying yield-bearing token that is compatible with the Pendle AMM (e.g. sUSDe → SY-sUSDe). SY is then split into its principal and yield components, PT (principal token) and YT (yield token) respectively, this process is termed as yield-tokenization, where the yield is tokenized into a separate token. Both PT and YT can be traded via Pendle’s AMM. Inverse Finance has created its first Pendle collateral market, PT-sUSDe-Mar272025, which matures on March 26 2025.

Accelerated Leverage Engine
The Accelerated Leverage Engine, or ALE, provides borrowers on FiRM with a way to instantly multiply their borrowing against a single collateral position up to 10 times their original loan amount. ALE is meant for experienced “power” users who understand the inherent risks of accelerated leverage.

What sets ALE apart from legacy borrow multipliers is the ability to borrow at fixed rates over long periods of time. Other borrow multipliers that rely on variable interest rates force borrowers to be more cautious in their use of a borrow multiplier, as highly leveraged positions are more sensitive to both volatility in the underlying collateral but also in additional debt added as a result of interest rate volatility. In addition, institutions, hedge funds, and others seeking certainty around their financing costs can at best only forecast those costs with variable rates, while fixed rates on FiRM provide certainty, in addition to the optionality of speculating on the price of DBR or locking interest rates in anticipation of future rate increases.

To utilize the Accelerated Leverage Engine, toggle the "Leverage / Looping" switch in the Deposit/Borrow screen:


Then use the slider to indicate your desired amount of leverage/looping:


Here's an explainer from a community member on how ALE works:

 https://youtu.be/79SxQO35Qv4


Please do your own research before using the Accelerated Leverage Engine. Leveraged looping in DeFi amplifies risks, including liquidation, price spirals during rapid position unwinding, protocol instabilities, and smart contract vulnerabilities. Users should employ risk management strategies, perform thorough due diligence, monitor investments closely, and stay informed about regulatory changes to effectively navigate these risks.

Replenishments
If you run out of DBR's while you have  an active loan, a third party will increase your DBR balance for you through a process called "replenishment." This process results in having DBR purchased for you but at a (much) higher price than the prevailing DBR market price. Replenishments are meant to be temporary fixes for when your DBR balance turns negative in order to prevent unwanted liquidations, so in order to avoid the cost of replenishments, you'll want to ensure your DBR balance is always sufficient to support your loan balances.

Liquidations
A liquidation is a process when a borrower's collateral does not adequately cover their loan/debt value. This might happen when the value of their collateral decreases (market movements, withdrawals from Anchor etc) or because the value of their debt increases (market movements, debt interest accrual etc).

If the value of a borrower's debt exceeds the value of their maximum permitted credit limit, up to 100% of their debt can be repaid by a liquidator. In return, the liquidator can seize the lenders collateral with a 10% bonus.

Example:

Bob deposits 1 WETH, which is worth $4000 at the time of deposit.

The maximum collateralization ratio on FiRM for a DOLA loan using WETH as collateral is 80%, meaning that the maximum Bob can borrow is 0.8 ETH worth of DOLA ($3,200).

Bob borrows 0.65 WETH worth of DOLA ($2,600), which puts his collateral ratio (Debt / Credit Limit factor) at 81.25%, generally viewed as a ratio at high risk for liquidation. 

Then, for example, the USD price of WETH drops dramatically by 25% in one block to $3,000. This decreases the maximum amount of DOLA that Bob can borrow (his credit limit) from $3,200 to $2,400.

The amount of Bob’s loan ($2,600) is now at $200 more (108%) than his credit limit ($2,400) and the loan is now considered insolvent. Bob can no longer withdraw his collateral from FiRM or borrow more until he has either repaid part of his debt or deposited more collateral to increase his credit limit. 

In a liquidation scenario, however, and before Bob can take direct action, an external liquidator notices that Bob’s loan is insolvent. The liquidator repays Bob’s entire (100%) outstanding debt of $2600 to FiRM. At the same time, the liquidator seizes $2600 worth of Bob’s WETH plus an additional 10% of his WETH as a liquidation “bonus”, or $320 in WETH. 

Bob now has no outstanding DOLA debt on FIRM and after liquidation costs, has $280 in WETH remaining on FiRM.

It is important to monitor the health of your loan to make sure that your outstanding debt does not exceed your credit limit. You can monitor the health of each of your loans by clicking on the individual market in FIRM:

Voting
Users depositing select governance tokens that carry voting rights as collateral in FiRM are able to vote and delegate their votes.

Each user's collateral is deposited into a personal escrow contract, which is deployed as gas efficiently as possible. Snapshot delegation is built into to the personal escrow account and whenever an escrow is initialized, it will automatically delegate to the owner. This means the voting power of your collateral gets delegated to your main wallet. It's also possible to move the delegation to a different address if you wish. 

FiRM Safety Features
Personal Collateral Escrows
FiRM and Inverse Finance does not custody any funds from FiRM users. All user funds are held in Personal Collateral Escrow contracts controlled by the user and are isolated both by individual user and by token type. This means that FiRM takes a step beyond shared pools of user collateral, commonly found in protocols like Compound Finance or Aave. The PCE’s are highly flexible which allows for individual collateral factors and borrowing limits per token and per position.

While no lending protocol is completely immune to hacks, PCE’s were designed to enable multiple new layers of security. First, by isolating deposits in such a granular fashion compared to cross-collateral pools, PCE’s no longer offer intruders a single pool of assets to target but rather many, smaller targets. Second, with a PCE a depositor’s collateral cannot be loaned. As the only borrowable asset in Inverse Finance’s implementation of PCE’s is DOLA and since borrowable DOLA is capped per collateral asset, the potential impact of a price oracle manipulation incident is reduced to an undue liquidation.

Pessimistic Price Oracles
This new approach to price oracles for borrows and liquidations in FiRM uses the lower of two recorded prices: either a) the current collateral price on Chainlink, or b) the 48-hour low price as observed by the PPO on Chainlink, divided by the collateral factor. For example, if the current Chainlink price for wETH is $1,500, the 48-hour low was $1,000 and the collateral factor is 80%, the PPO returns $1,250. ($1,000 / .80 = $1,250)

Attackers who rely on flash loans and other short-term techniques will be frustrated by the implementation of PPO’s.

First, using the 48-hour low price minimizes the risk of FiRM allowing borrows against a rapidly and artificially inflated collateral asset price.

Second, dividing the 48-hour low price by the collateral factor creates a bias for more conservatism with volatile collateral and more freedom for less volatile collateral like stablecoins.

Finally, the PPO provides greater protection for FiRM along with its other security features such as preventing users from borrowing against more than the lowest recorded value of their collateral over the prior two days. Daily borrow limits curtail the amount of funds at risk and user collateral is not pooled but held separately in an entirely non-custodial way.

Protocol Safety

The PPO reduces the probability of short-term and flash-loan type oracle price manipulation attacks.

Many oracle price manipulations occur due to low liquidity in a market. For tokens with low liquidity, we believe PPO’s offer a useful tool for lenders and borrowers.

Healthier Borrowing

For those engaged in high-frequency arbitrage or impulse trading, especially with volatile assets, PPO’s may not be ideal. However for long-term borrowers, the target market for FiRM, PPO’s provide added safety for both borrowers and Inverse Finance.

Flexible

The PPO’s observation window can be adjusted over time in either direction, as can collateral factors. 

Daily Borrow Limits
A daily borrow limit sets a ceiling on the total amount of DOLA available for loans on any given day in each market. A daily borrow limit helps Inverse reduce its risk exposure on a per-market basis and in the future will allow for the support of more high-risk collateral assets and even PCE’s with customized borrow limits. This limit is adjusted regularly by the RWG as the system matures.

Contract Address Whitelist
A contract address whitelist is a list of approved contract addresses that are allowed to interact with a particular smart contract. This is often used as a security measure to prevent unauthorized contracts from accessing or modifying the data or functionality of the whitelisted contract.

As a precaution against flash loan attacks, FiRM only allows whitelisted contract interactions. This allows regular user wallets to interact while it at the same time limits any automated attacks, forcing any attacker to be extremely well-capitalized. Flashloan attacks require contract interactions and are therefore impossible. This prevents single-transaction attacks like the one Euler suffered, but also makes it more of a hassle for other protocols to integrate with FiRM, as they will need to contact us for a whitelisting. We consider this a worthy trade-off.

Cover

Users can purchase "cover", which is a decentralized "insurance alternative" to protect against smart contract and other risks when using FiRM. OpenCover offers cover for assets deposited in FiRM, as well as sDOLA. Cover is underwritten by Nexus Mutual and claims are subject to DAO governance vote before payout. The Nexus Mutual docs are a good place to explore how cover works. 

FAQ’s
What is FiRM?

FiRM is a new Fixed-Rate Market for borrowing DOLA using DBR tokens and it is focused on simplicity and safety. All markets are isolated and collateral cannot be borrowed by others.

How safe is FiRM?

FiRM does not have shared collateral pools like traditional DeFi markets. FiRM uses Personal Collateral Escrows which ensures that deposits are not only isolated per collateral but also per user. FiRM also has flash loan protection and a limited amount of borrowable DOLA per market. FiRM has been audited by Code4arena. Still, all users are advised to do their own research as using DeFi products is risky and can result in a loss of funds.

What is DBR?

DBR, or DOLA Borrowing Right, is a borrowing right token. Holding it in your wallet gives you the right to borrow one DOLA stablecoin in FiRM for one year. Or, for example, the right to borrow 12 DOLA in FiRM for one month.

What is DOLA?

DOLA is a stablecoin pegged to the US Dollar. This means it is designed to be valued as close to $1 as possible with minimal volatility. DOLA is debt-backed rather than algorithmic, meaning that DOLA is backed by retractable debt.

How much can I borrow with one DBR?

One DBR gives the right to borrow 1 DOLA for 1 year (or 2 DOLA for 6 months, etc). This is assuming you have deposited enough collateral.

Is DBR an ERC20 token?

Yes but not a standard ERC-20 token: your DBR wallet balance will decrease over time when you have an open loan position.

How can I get DBR tokens?

You can get DBR by acquiring it simultaneously with your DOLA loan, swapping for it on a DEX, via the DBR XY=K Auction, by staking INV and receiving DBR streaming rewards, 

Do I need to stake DBR?

No, DBRs should stay in your wallet to pay the fee when you have a loan. Your DBR wallet balance will decrease only if you have a DOLA loan in FiRM.

Why does my DBR balance decrease?

DBRs are "spent" over time when you have a loan, the rate depends on your amount of debt. If you don't have a loan the balance does not decrease.

What happens if I run out of DBRs?

If you run out of DBR's while you have  an active loan a third party will increase your DBR balance for you through a process called "replenishment." This process results in having DBR purchased for you but at a (much) higher price than the prevailing DBR market price. Replenishments are meant to be temporary fixes for when your DBR balance turns negative in order to prevent unwanted liquidations, so in order to avoid the cost of replenishments, you'll want to ensure your DBR balance is always sufficient to support your loan balances.

Is front running mitigated by FiRM?

As a lending market, front running does not put user funds at risk. The worst case scenario in a front running scenario, is that a user’s transaction fails due to there not being enough liquidity in the lending market.

Can flashloan attacks be applied to FiRM, and if so, how are flashloan attack risks mitigated?

A flashloan attack can be applied to the protocol if a price oracle turns out to be faulty. Therefore we only allow whitelisted contracts to interact with the protocol. To mitigate oracle risk, we only use assets with chainlink oracles.

DOLA Feds
DOLA Supply Management

DOLA Fed contracts are made to expand and contract DOLA supply. They are controlled by Inverse Finance governance and they are a powerful tool for DOLA peg management. 

There are two different types of Fed contracts. Both share some qualities like having the ability to expand DOLA supply by minting and supplying DOLA directly to the connected liquidity pool or lending market DOLA supply while a contraction withdraws and burns DOLA.

A great way to keep track of all the ‘expansions’ and ‘contractions’ of DOLA supply is via the ‘Feds Policy & Income’ or 'DOLA & Feds' tabs on the Transparency page.

DOLA Fixed Rate Lending Fed on FiRM
The DOLA Fed on FiRM expands and contracts the DOLA supply for that lending market. The FiRM Fed has a global DOLA limit and a limit per FiRM market, both set by governance and enforced by the fed chair.

DOLA DEX Liquidity Feds
DOLA DEX Liquidity Feds expand by minting and supplying DOLA directly to the a decentralized exchange (DEX) liquidity pool while a contraction withdraws and burns DOLA from the pool. Expansions/contractions are done in response to demand changes for DOLA in a specific liquidity pool.

If the pool requires the Fed to supply proportional amounts of one or more assets, the new DOLA supplied to the pool by the Fed is effectively backed by the counterparty asset in the pool. The Fed's DOLA liquidity never enters traded circulation in a regular sense, the feds revert the process completely when done, sometimes creating valuable arbitrage for the DAO treasury.

If a user expresses demand to the point where there are significantly fewer DOLA than normal in the pool, the Fed can be expanded to bring the pool back to balance. This can happen when a user deposits a counterparty token in the pool, or someone swaps for DOLA. In addition to being profitable for the DAO, this also balances DOLA’s $1.00 price peg.

When the demand for DOLA decreases, the Fed Chair contracts the DOLA supply, reducing the DOLA overweight in the pool, bringing the price or peg back to par.

Simply put, the goal is to find equilibrium for DOLA:

Demand for DOLA increases = AMM Fed increases DOLA supply to match this.

Demand for DOLA decreases = AMM Fed decreases DOLA supply to match this.

This is a very powerful mechanism for peg management and gives Inverse Finance the ability to scale DOLA supply up or down rapidly in each individual liquidity pool, ensuring a more stable peg even in highly volatile times.

While DOLA is deposited in the liquidity pool, the Fed earns any rewards sent to LP’s which in turn are sent back to the DAO Treasury. The current policy is to recycle these rewards back into “bribes” to the liquidity pool, subsidizing the liquidity expense of the DAO, otherwise paid in INV.

Providing Liquidity
Liquidity Pools
Decentralized liquidity pools enable trading of tokens and are a fundamental money lego enabling open blockchain markets. Anyone can provide liquidity and you have self-custody over the funds. Note that liquidity pools with volatile tokens can incur impermanent loss (or divergence loss) as the asset values move apart.

What Are Liquidity Pools?
Liquidity pools are on-chain contracts that provide a "place" to securely pool tokens (which can be called liquidity) so that users can use them to make trades in a decentralized way. The weighting of tokens in the pool determines the price for swapping between the tokens. Curve takes its name from elegant curve mathematics which allow for highly efficient swaps despite large imbalances in the pools.

These pools are created by users and decentralized apps (or Dapps, for short) who want to enable new token markets and profit from their usage. To pool liquidity, the amount a user supplies must be equally divided between two coins: the primary token (sometimes called the quote token) and the base token (usually ETH or a stable coin).

Curve's, Balancer's and Velodrome's liquidity pools all allow anyone to provide liquidity. Upon doing so, they will receive LP tokens (Liquidity Provider tokens). If a user deposits $INV and $ETH into a pool, they would receive INV-ETH LP tokens. These tokens represent a proportional share of the pooled assets, allowing a user to reclaim their funds at any point.

Every time another user uses the pool to trade between $INV and $ETH, a fee is taken on the trade which goes back to the LP pool.

The value of the SLP tokens is updated with each trade and the price for swapping the tokens is set by the weighting of the balance between the tokens in the pool. For example:

If previously there were 100 SLP tokens representing 100 ETH and 100 INV, each token would be worth 1 ETH & 1 INV (note in this example, ETH and INV are the same relative value). If a user were to trade 10 ETH for 10 INV in that pool, and another user were to trade 10 INV for 10 ETH, then there would now be 100.025 ETH and 100.025 INV. This means each LP token would be worth 1.0025 ETH and 1.00025 INV when it is withdrawn.

Provide Liquidity to help DOLA grow!
Deep DOLA liquidity is vital to the success and growth of Inverse Finance. For Stablecoin liquidity, currently it is most efficient to use Curve pools as these pools keep the peg of the stablecoin far better thane most other 50:50 pools. Note: Not all DOLA Curve As these liquidity pools are paired with dollar stablecoins only, meaning the risk of impairment loss is presently very low. Liquidity pools paired with dollar stablecoins only are such that meaning that liquidity providers can collect trading fees and other incentives at a relatively lower risk of impermanent loss.

When depositing liquidity, you will receive an LP token in return. This LP token is what proves your stake in the liquidity pool and you need it to be able to withdraw your funds. Trading fees and/or token incentives are accumulated to the liquidity providers are added your balance automatically.

Note that Inverse Finance does not officially endorse or advise you to use any protocol, all DeFi and smart-contract interactions carry some form of risk. ALL yield strategies carry additional smart contract risk. Many yield opportunities mentioned on this page have not been audited by Inverse Finance. Different strategies carry different levels of risk, with some subject to potential impermanent loss or divergence loss can become a risk when DOLA is paired with volatile tokens, such as INV or wETH. Ensure that you do your own due diligence prior to interacting with any, and never invest more money than you are willing to lose.

DCA Vaults
DCA Vaults (deprecated)

Inverse Finance’s first product launched was the DCA (dollar cost average) vaults. The DCA Vaults generate yield on stablecoins and continuously invest the yield in a target token e.g. ETH. While initially a very successful product, the DAO decided to focus resources on the growth of DOLA rather than improvements to the DCA Vaults.

As the profitability of the Vaults to the Inverse Finance Treasury decreased, it was decided that the vaults would be deprecated, meaning they would be no longer funded with Ethereum in order to fund the gas required to invest in the target token.

How to Withdraw from DCA Vaults
Despite being deprecated, the DCA Vaults smart contracts are still live and active on Ethereum Mainnet (and will be forever). It is recommended that users who still have crypto held within these smart contracts should withdraw their capital from them. The DCA Vaults are no longer displayed on the current Inverse Finance UI. However, the vaults can be accessed through the UI of the old Inverse Finance website. This website can be accessed through the following link:

https://old.inverse.finance/vaults

Users will be able to claim any profits and withdraw all capital using this website.

Frontier
*Borrowing is paused on Frontier. All INV stakers need to migrate their stake to FiRM to receive DBR APY*

Frontier is a money-market smart-contract protocol similar to Maker, Compound and Synthetix, but it facilitates capital efficient lending & borrowing via the issuance of synthetic tokens (eg DOLA) & or tokens deposited into Frontier (eg borrowing tokens such as ETH).

Frontier launched on the 25th February 2021 under the name Anchor.

Price Manipulation Incidents
In April 2022, Frontier (at the time named “Anchor”) suffered a price oracle manipulation incident. Via a sophisticated and capital-intensive market manipulation, a hacker was able to withdraw over $15.6M in user funds. By successfully manipulating the price of $INV, the hacker heavily inflated the value of INV which was used as collateral. This allowed them to borrow from Anchor’s pools.

According to sources here and here, the hacker’s tactic revealed an unforeseen attack vector. In other words, this was not an obvious vulnerability. Altogether, the hacker was able to run away with 1,588 ETH, 94 WBTC, 39 YFI, and 3,999,669 DOLA (worth $15.6M at the time). For more detail on this incident, refer to any of the resources shared above or the Inverse blog post.

A second incident occurred in June 2022. Inverse Finance’s Frontier money market was subject to an oracle price manipulation incident that resulted in a net loss of $5.83 million in DOLA with the attacker earning a total of $1.2 million. The affected market—yvcrv3crypto—utilized Chainlink price data instead of the internal exchange rate of the Curve protocol, which allowed the attacker to flash-borrow 27,000 in wBTC and trade it into the tricrypto pool, which caused the price of the yvcrv3crypto LP token to jump in value in the eyes of the oracle. This created an opportunity to borrow DOLA against that collateral in Frontier. Read more about this incident here.


The two attacks left many Anchor users stuck with IOU tokens (called anTokens). Over 24% of the TVL at that time was stolen, leaving Inverse Finance with a significant bad debt. As an initial response, Anchor was paused and the DAO began working on solutions to repay the bad debt and reimburse affected users.

Repaying debt in a fair manner, where sophisticated users don’t hold an advantage, is hard. In the case of Inverse Finance, we prioritized making sure that enough liquidity enters the system so that remaining loans can be liquidated. Had we not prioritized that, even more bad debt would have built up over time. However, as all liquidity that entered the system was sniped by liquidators, and any leftovers were quickly scooped up by sophisticated users running bots leaving regular users on the bottom rung, it was clear something had to be done.

A governance vote enacted the deployment of the DebtRepayer and the DebtConverter. These two contracts were developed to mitigate the impact to the DAO and to help users who want access to their funds sooner. 

Debt Converter
The Debt Converter contract lets users convert their stuck collateral denominated in YFI/ETH/wBTC to be DOLA denominated instead. It does this by letting affected users willingly transfer their anTokens to a converter, which issues them DOLA IOUs in exchange.

The motivation for the user is the ability to lock in a DOLA denominated value for their assets. The benefit for Inverse Finance DAO is the ability to turn our debt from volatile tokens into stable coins. It also allows users, who are not quick to withdraw their funds, to gradually withdraw as InverseDAO repays its debt. DOLA IOUs will accrue interest with variable APY which is controlled by governance.

The contract allows users to convert their bad debt anTokens into an equal DOLA amount worth of DOLA IOUs. The anTokens will be valued at their current market price in dollars, which is fetched from ChainLink feeds. There is no discount for this debt conversion as there is for the Debt Repayer.

Governance can set a maxConvertPrice for each anToken which represents the maximum value this contract will pay per underlying token. For example, assume anETH has a maxConvertPrice of 1,500e18 & a market price of $1,600. A user that redeems 1 ETH worth of anETH will only receive 1500 DOLA worth of IOUs.

Debt Repayer
The core idea of the Debt Repayer is to let people pull their money out before others, if they’re willing to receive less than the full amount in doing so. s it is opt-in, it’s a fair ordering mechanism that reduces the total debt burden. This means that every time someone decides to exit early, the date of the last repayment comes a little bit closer. Essentially, users that exit early will push forward the date of the last user to exit.

This contract allows users to redeem bad debt anTokens for the native asset that they represent, but at a discount. The smart contract works on a reserve basis, where as long as there is 15% or more of liquidity stored in the contract compared to the total outstanding debt, users can exit without any cut.

As Inverse Finance adds assets to the market and the debt reserves of the contract increase, the discount is reduced using a linear model with parameters set by governance. Those wishing to redeem their anTokens early, before much reserves have had time to accumulate, will take a steeper discount than those redeeming later when reserves are higher. anTokens will eventually be redeemable at one-to-one value with their underlying, once a certain threshold of reserves are met. What reduction in payout can a user expect below 15%? It depends on the total amount of reserves. The payout has a linear progression from keeping 45% of book value at 0% reserves, up to keeping 100% of book value at 15% reserves and above.


Reserve ratio is calculated for each asset by dividing the total amount in each V1 market by the borrow balance of the exploiter.

The debt repayer contract was deployed with the following parameters: Max Discount: 55% Zero discount reserve threshold: 15%. Both the minimum payout and the reserve requirements are subject to change by Inverse Finance DAO governance.

A usage example could be as follows:

The ETH/WBTC/YFI V1 market anToken discount is dynamic so please check the current exchange rate on the interface, and it was set to be redeemable at an initial discount of 55% when the debt repayment contract has a reserve ratio of 0%. The zero discount reserve threshold is 15%. As the Treasury Working Group dollar-cost average buys the bad debt assets, a proportion of these buys are sent to the debt repayment contract which causes the stores of YFI, Eth and wBTC in the contract to slowly fill, raising the reserve ratio for each asset. At 5% reserves, a user can redeem their Eth debt at a 36.6% discount. At 10% reserves, the discount falls to 18.3%. At 15% reserves or more, the discount will be at 0%.

Reserve ratios are calculated separately for each debt asset. If there is 75 ETH stored in the debt repayment contract, and there is 1,000 ETH currently stuck in the ETH V1 market on Frontier then the reserve ratio will be 7.5%, meaning currently the available discount is 27.5%. If a user with 34.5 ETH stuck in V1 markets decides to withdraw all of their ETH in this moment, they’ll receive 25 ETH from the debt contract (27.5% discount). This reduces the debt contract’s ETH balance to 50 ETH, and the reserve ratio to 5%, meaning that the next available discount to a user will be 36.6%.

At this point, the 34.5 ETH of anETH is sent to the TWG. The TWG can then use currently stored ETH in the Treasury to repay this full 34.5 ETH from the bad debt, meaning the new total of ETH in V1 markets becomes 965.5 ETH (1,000 - 34.5). The TWG will direct a proportion of ETH/WBTC/YFI assets for repayment to this contract. This proportion will be determined each time based on the current context of the repayment situation. The rest of the ETH/WBTC/YFI will be used for liquidations and adding liquidity to the V1 markets like before.

Bad Debt Dashboard
This dashboard shows the bad debts and repayments both over time and per transaction.

There are two types of DOLA bad debt:

DOLA bad debt is debt that originated from a DOLA fed, ie the backing of DOLA.

Debt that originates from users borrowing DOLA in Frontier without repaying (exploiter).

To better manage daily operations, Inverse has many permissioned roles. Most are assigned to working groups via governance proposals. The RWG assumes a head-of-multisigs role, ensuring, amongst other things, that safety and best practices are instilled in the daily practices of all signers. This form of governance is designed to be transparent, decentralized, and inclusive, and is intended to give our token holders a direct say in the direction of the DAO, whilst simultaneously maximizing DAO output. We believe that this governance model is the best way to ensure that the interests of our token holders are aligned with the success of the DAO, and that we can continue to remain relevant in a rapidly growing industry where laggards are left behind.

An overview of all working groups and multi-sigs can be seen here and are listed below:

Bug Bounty
ImmuneFi Vault
Inverse Finance Sec-Ops Team has set up a 100,000 DOLA Bug Bounty vault on the ImmuneFi Platform. Users can report bugs anonymously through ImmuneFi to be reviewed by our committee. Read more about the Bug Bounty Program here.

Assets in Scope
All smart contracts of Inverse Finance can be found at https://github.com/InverseFinance. However, only those items explicitly listed in the Assets list below are considered eligible for Inverse’s bug bounty program and, therefore, in-scope. We consider bug bounties to be a lasting complement to any external or in-house security audit capabilities that Inverse Finance develops. As such, smart contracts will only be eligible for the Bug Bounty Program once they have undergone our review process which may include rigorous testing by a third party auditor.

Direct theft of any user NFTs, whether at-rest or in-motion, other than unclaimed royalties

Permanent freezing of funds

Permanent freezing of NFTs

Unauthorized minting of NFTs

Predictable or manipulable RNG that results in abuse of the principal or NFT

Unintended alteration of what the NFT represents (e.g. token URI, payload, artistic content)

Protocol insolvency

Theft of unclaimed yield

Theft of unclaimed royalties

Permanent freezing of unclaimed yield

Permanent freezing of unclaimed royalties

Websites and Applications

Direct theft of user funds

Malicious interactions with an already-connected wallet, such as: Modifying transaction arguments or parameters, Substituting contract addresses, Submitting malicious transactions

High

Temporary freezing of funds

Out of Scope
These impacts are out of scope for this bug bounty program.

All Categories:

Impacts requiring attacks that the reporter has already exploited themselves, leading to damage

Impacts caused by attacks requiring access to leaked keys/credentials

Impacts caused by attacks requiring access to privileged addresses (governance, strategist) except in such cases where the contracts are intended to have no privileged access to functions that make the attack possible

Impacts relying on attacks involving the depegging of an external stablecoin where the attacker does not directly cause the depegging due to a bug in code

Mentions of secrets, access tokens, API keys, private keys, etc. in Github will be considered out of scope without proof that they are in-use in production

Best practice recommendations

Feature requests

Impacts on test files and configuration files unless stated otherwise in the bug bounty program

Blockchain/DLT & Smart Contract Specific:

Incorrect data supplied by third party oracles

Not to exclude oracle manipulation/flash loan attacks

Impacts requiring basic economic and governance attacks (e.g. 51% attack)

Lack of liquidity impacts

Impacts from Sybil attacks

Impacts involving centralization risks

Websites and Apps

Theoretical impacts without any proof or demonstration

Impacts involving attacks requiring physical access to the victim device

Impacts involving attacks requiring access to the local network of the victim
